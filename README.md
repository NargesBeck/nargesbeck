### Hi there!
I'm a Game Developer (more specifically, a Unity Developer, even more specifically, a Gameplay and Tools programmer). I'm also a Software Engineering Bachelor Degree graduate.

- ðŸ”­ My main project is Puzzixle (a nonogram game), and it will be published afterwards.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently challenging myself to expand my skills from client-side to server-side, and from mobile platforms to PC.

- ðŸ‘¯ If you're looking for something to collaborate on, DoodlerTool is going to be a tool to create a specific art style, using math and code. I am hoping once it's done, other developers find it as useful and interesting as I do.

- ðŸ“« If you wanna contact me directly:
