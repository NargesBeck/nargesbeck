### Hi there!
I'm a Game Developer (more specifically, a Unity Developer, even more specifically, a Gameplay and Tools programmer). I'm also an (almost) Software Engineering Bachelor Degree graduate.

- ðŸ”­ My main project is Puzzixle (a nonogram game), and it will be published afterwards. The code is available for anyone to take a look.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently challenging myself to expand my skills from client-side to server-side, and from mobile platforms to PC.

- ðŸ‘¯ If you're looking for something to collaborate on, DoodlerTool is going to be a tool to create a specific art style, using math and code. I am hoping once it's done, other developers find it as useful and interestiing as I do.

- ðŸ“« I have a github page in the making:
   https://nargesbeck.github.io/BZdio
   If you wanna contact me directly:
